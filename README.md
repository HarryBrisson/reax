# reax
 slack reacts for (a broader range of) humans

** this was a mini-hackathon project completed on Juneteenth & Independence Day weekends in 2020 **

### challenges
when reacting on Slack, occasionally folx get into the challenge where they don't want to appropriate the ethnicity of another person.  some people don't strongly identify with a race and/or gender.  the hope with `reax` is to provide an alternative to white-as-default (or yellow-as-default aka pseudo-white-as-default) that creates a more inclusive environment on Slack.

### download
you can download the emojis in the gifs folder; I intend to eventually upload them elsewhere as well.


### more ideas
* sequence race and ethnicity in animations more deliberately (currently random) perhaps by bringing most marginalized groups to the front, a la "BIPOC".
* use transitions to capture more than just the 5 default skintones.
* generate these reacts for emoji libraries that aren't iOS (perhaps [openmoji](https://openmoji.org/)?).


### note
while my hope is that this project can make real progress in better representing communities of color and non-binary communities in Slack reactions, serious problems like police violence and economic inequality require policy solutions.  a list of BLM partners you can donate to is found [here](https://blacklivesmatter.com/partners/).  symbolic change is not a substitute for deep systemic change.  I will continue to self-educate and try to identify more meaningful ways to elevate the voices of marginalized communities.
